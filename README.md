## About
Usually, I want to collect some images from a website, I write a simple spider and download what I want. All the envrionment is under Python3, and some other components should be installed, too. The pictures in the folder, which are downloaded by itself, are picked up from the downloadings. ;-)

## the weibo spider
'[weibo](http://weibo.com)' is a social website like twitter. The script can download the weibo users' posts(pictures), and users' ID and how many pages' of posts will be downloaded can be configured in the script, after running, pictures will be stored in the folder which named by the user ID.
